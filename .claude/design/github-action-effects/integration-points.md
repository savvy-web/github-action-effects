# Integration Points

## Overview

Peer dependencies, external integrations, and how services compose in
`@savvy-web/github-action-effects`.

See [index.md](./index.md) for architecture overview.
See [layers.md](./layers.md) for layer dependency graph.

## Peer Dependencies

### Required Peers

**effect** -- Core dependency. Services use `Context.GenericTag`, `Layer`,
`Schema`, `Data.TaggedError`, `FiberRef`, `Logger`, and `Tracer`.

**@effect/platform and @effect/platform-node** -- `Action.run()` provides
`NodeContext.layer` from `@effect/platform-node`, giving programs access to
`FileSystem`, `Path`, `Terminal`, `CommandExecutor`, and `WorkerManager`.
Several services (ConfigLoader, ChangesetAnalyzer, WorkspaceDetector,
PackagePublish) depend on `FileSystem` from `@effect/platform`.

**@actions/core** -- Primary integration for input reading, output setting,
logging, annotations, state, and secrets. All interactions go through the
`ActionsCore` wrapper service. Only `ActionsCoreLive` imports this package
directly.

### Optional Peers

| Package | Wrapper Service | Live Layer | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@actions/github` | `ActionsGitHub` | `ActionsGitHubLive` | Authenticated Octokit provider |
| `@actions/exec` | `ActionsExec` | `ActionsExecLive` | Shell command execution |
| `@actions/cache` | `ActionsCache` | `ActionsCacheLive` | Cache save/restore |
| `@actions/tool-cache` | `ActionsToolCache` | `ActionsToolCacheLive` | Tool download, extract, cache |
| `@octokit/auth-app` | `OctokitAuthApp` | `OctokitAuthAppLive` | GitHub App JWT authentication |
| `semver` | (none) | SemverResolver | Semver comparison and resolution |
| `jsonc-parser` | (none) | ConfigLoader.loadJsonc | JSONC config file support |
| `yaml` | (none) | ConfigLoader.loadYaml | YAML config file support |

All optional peers are marked `optional: true` in `peerDependenciesMeta`.
The `@actions/*` and `@octokit/auth-app` packages are exclusively imported by
their corresponding wrapper Live layers. All domain Live layers consume these
packages through the wrapper services via `Layer.effect` and `yield*`.

All Live layers use static imports exclusively. `@vercel/ncc` cannot follow
dynamic `import()` calls, so static imports are required for reliable ncc
bundling. The `@actions/*` packages are statically imported only by the 6
platform wrapper Live layers; domain Live layers use `yield*` DI instead.
Consumers do not need bare `import` hints in their entry points.

## Service Dependency Graph

```text
Tier 0 — Platform wrappers (import @actions/* directly, no service dependencies):
  ActionsCore, ActionsGitHub, ActionsCache, ActionsExec,
  ActionsToolCache, OctokitAuthApp

Tier 1 — Depend on platform wrappers:
  ActionInputs              -> ActionsCore
  ActionLogger              -> ActionsCore
  ActionOutputs             -> ActionsCore
  ActionState               -> ActionsCore
  ActionCache               -> ActionsCache
  CommandRunner             -> ActionsExec
  GitHubClient(token)       -> ActionsGitHub
  GitHubApp                 -> OctokitAuthApp
  ToolInstaller             -> ActionsCore + ActionsToolCache

Tier 1 — Independent (no service dependencies):
  ActionEnvironment, DryRun,
  GithubMarkdown, SemverResolver, ErrorAccumulator,
  ReportBuilder

Tier 2 — Single service dependency:
  NpmRegistry               -> CommandRunner
  ChangesetAnalyzer         -> FileSystem
  ConfigLoader              -> FileSystem
  TokenPermissionChecker    -> GitHubApp

Tier 3 — GitHubClient dependents:
  GitHubGraphQL             -> GitHubClient
  GitBranch                 -> GitHubClient
  GitCommit                 -> GitHubClient
  GitTag                    -> GitHubClient
  GitHubRelease             -> GitHubClient
  GitHubIssue               -> GitHubClient + GitHubGraphQL
  CheckRun                  -> GitHubClient
  PullRequestComment        -> GitHubClient
  RateLimiter               -> GitHubClient
  WorkflowDispatch          -> GitHubClient
  PackageManagerAdapter     -> CommandRunner + FileSystem
  WorkspaceDetector         -> FileSystem + CommandRunner

Tier 4 — Multi-service dependencies:
  PackagePublish            -> CommandRunner + NpmRegistry + FileSystem
  AutoMerge (utility)       -> GitHubGraphQL
```

### ActionsPlatformLive as the Integration Point

`ActionsPlatformLive` is `Layer.mergeAll` of all 6 platform wrapper Live
layers. It is the single integration point for wiring the real `@actions/*`
packages into the domain Live layer stack:

```text
ActionsPlatformLive
  ├── ActionsCoreLive    -> ActionInputsLive, ActionLoggerLive,
  │                         ActionOutputsLive, ActionStateLive,
  │                         ToolInstallerLive (partial)
  ├── ActionsGitHubLive  -> GitHubClientLive(token)
  ├── ActionsCacheLive   -> ActionCacheLive
  ├── ActionsExecLive    -> CommandRunnerLive
  ├── ActionsToolCacheLive -> ToolInstallerLive (partial)
  └── OctokitAuthAppLive -> GitHubAppLive
```

### Layer Provision for Tier 3+

```text
GitHubClientLive(token)   (requires ActionsGitHub)
  -> CheckRunLive              (requires GitHubClient in context)
  -> PullRequestCommentLive    (requires GitHubClient in context)
  -> GitHubGraphQLLive         (requires GitHubClient in context)
  -> GitBranchLive             (requires GitHubClient in context)
  -> GitCommitLive             (requires GitHubClient in context)
  -> GitTagLive                (requires GitHubClient in context)
  -> GitHubReleaseLive         (requires GitHubClient in context)
  -> GitHubIssueLive           (requires GitHubClient + GitHubGraphQL)
  -> RateLimiterLive           (requires GitHubClient in context)
  -> WorkflowDispatchLive      (requires GitHubClient in context)

Test layers for all Tier 3 services do NOT depend on GitHubClient --
they operate entirely in-memory.
```

## Optional Integrations

### @savvy-web/github-action-builder

Actions built with the builder benefit from this library but it is not
required. Any Node.js 24 action can use these services.

## Current State

All peer dependencies and service tiers are documented with a complete dependency
graph. The platform wrapper services isolate all `@actions/*` imports behind
Effect service interfaces. `ActionsPlatformLive` is the single integration point
for wiring real platform packages into the layer stack. Optional integrations for
OpenTelemetry and the action builder are specified with their activation
conditions.

## Rationale

Separating required from optional peer dependencies and organizing services into dependency tiers ensures consumers only install what they need, while the tiered graph makes layer composition predictable and testable at each level.
